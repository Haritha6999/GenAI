# GenAI

This project leverages Google's Gemini API on Vertex AI to build an intelligent assistant that analyzes real-time market conditions and technical indicators to recommend: Top 3 intraday trades from NIFTY 50 or BankNifty options. A high-potential small-cap stock for short-term investment. The model adheres strictly to pre-defined trading rules, including: Minimum 2:1 Reward-to-Risk ratio. Liquidity and confluence-based filtering. Fail-safe logic to avoid suggesting low-confidence trades. The user prompt and system instructions are carefully crafted to ensure high-quality, actionable financial outputs, and the results are printed in a structured format. Technologies Used: Google Gemini (via google-genai): Utilized the gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20 model for fast, high-quality content generation based on system and user inputs. Vertex AI (GCP): Used to securely run and scale the Gemini model through GCP. Python: Core logic, API integration, and content streaming. Prompt Engineering: Detailed instructions and safety settings ensure reliable and domain-specific output. GCP Authentication: Secure access via gcloud auth application-default login. Key Features: Intelligent stock selection based on defined risk/reward parameters. Market-aware, technically grounded recommendations. Safe, filtered, and bias-free generation with customized safety settings. Scalable and easily extendable with real-time market data APIs (e.g., Upstox, ICICI Direct).
